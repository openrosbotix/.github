# Welcone to OpenROSBotix
Welcome to my organization named OpenROSBotix. This organization contains a variety of common ROS and ROS2 packages I build for my robots. Also you find open source plans and instructions to build
one of my ROS-enabled open source robots.

# Open source robots
Currently, I'm building a lawn mower. You can print the entire chassis by yourself. For motors, I use hoverboard motors and their controllers as motor driver. More details can be found here
